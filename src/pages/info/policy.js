        If you are over 15 minutes late your appointment will be rescheduled due
        to the consultation with paperwork, numbing cream and the procedure
        itself. We work back to back in all clinics so lateness throws the whole
        salons day off. If you know your going to be a few minutes late please
        message or call us.
      </p>

        If you are wanting extra treatments please let us know prior to the day
        so we can book out enough time. We do not rush with our clients, we take
        pride in building relationships and offering the best level of customer
        service we possibly can. Consultations may be prior to your appointment
        or on the day of your appointment depending on what treatment you are
        having.

        Please note that children are not covered by insurance to be in the
        clinic. Please come alone to your appointment unless you have booked a
        joint appointment, please come together.

        If you have any questions please feel free to DM, email or call us. This
        information can be found in 'contact' above our story highlights.
